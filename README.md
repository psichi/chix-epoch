In the beginning there was nothing, so we must create & create & create.

Therefor let's start with something empty and create.

So what is created can be sold & sold & sold.

What is created must become better & better & better.

So what is created can be sold & sold & sold.

To become better & better & better our base must be strong.

Therefor we should increase reusability, so what is created can still be sold.

Falling behind is not an option. Standing still is decline.

Generation, automation. Must keep up with creation for standing still is decline.
